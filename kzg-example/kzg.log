Trace dimensions:
  Rows (height): 1024
  Columns (width): 2
  Trace generation time: 14.041µs

First 10 Fibonacci numbers in the trace:
  Step 0: f(n)=1, f(n+1)=1
  Step 1: f(n)=1, f(n+1)=2
  Step 2: f(n)=2, f(n+1)=3
  Step 3: f(n)=3, f(n+1)=5
  Step 4: f(n)=5, f(n+1)=8
  Step 5: f(n)=8, f(n+1)=13
  Step 6: f(n)=13, f(n+1)=21
  Step 7: f(n)=21, f(n+1)=34
  Step 8: f(n)=34, f(n+1)=55
  Step 9: f(n)=55, f(n+1)=89
